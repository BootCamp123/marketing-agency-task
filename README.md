# Marketing Agency Refactor

## Description

I was given a web page which i was told to change in order to meet accessibility standards. Then i was given the source code in which elements were placed as divs which i had to change to the correct semantic elements. In order to find the correct semantic elements i used google and other websites to help me find the correct elements for the position.
This is the webpage that i was given to change. below is a screenshot of the website.
